# ComplexNumbers
A Java library for basic operations with complex numbers. Following operations are supported:

## Addition
```
result = number1.add(number2);
```

## Subtraction
```
result = number1.subtract(number2);
```

## Multiplication
```
result = number1.multiply(number2);
```

## Division
```
result = number1.divide(number2);
```

## SquareRoot
```
result = number1.squareRoot;
```

## Power
```
result = number1.power(3);
```

## Equality
```
 if (number1.equal(number2))
 {
   ...
 }
```

## Final remarks
 1. This library was built using Java 17
 2. Excessive conversion between representation may lead to loss of precision
